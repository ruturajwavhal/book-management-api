Build a REST API for managing a list of books.
Requirements:

GET /books → Get all books

GET /books/{id} → Get book by ID

POST /books → Add new book

PUT /books/{id} → Update book details

DELETE /books/{id} → Delete a book

Book fields: id, title, author, price, isbn.

Concepts: CRUD operations, @RestController, @RequestMapping, basic JSON handling.
